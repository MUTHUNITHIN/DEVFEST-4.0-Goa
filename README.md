> 📍The classical Gift recommendation is based on occasion based or random suggestion based ones.
>📍As per the track, we built an ***AI-driven tool*** that provides personalized  gift suggestions based on the user's personality traits and preferences.
>📍We created ***25-question personality survey*** to understand the user's preferences
>📍Use ***AI*** to ***rank*** 20 predefined gift items based on the **survey responses**
>📍The ML model is trained using ***virtual dataset*** each selection created randomly
>📍Then  ***GIFT Item*** recommended  is the prediction of ML model
